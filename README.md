# Spacewatch

### Monitor the available free space on your server with a dashboard widget and optional notification that gets sent when you reach a specified threshold

## Description

Spacewatch gives you a breakdown of the total space available on your server right from your dashboard by appending a small progress bar right to the *At a Glance* widget.

You can also completely configure the notification email:
* Receive daily alerts regardless of warning level
* Receive daily alerts once you have 41%-60% free space remaining
* Receive daily alerts once you have 21%-40% free space remaining
* Receive daily alerts once you have 0%-20% free space remaining

## Installation

1. Upload the `spacewatch` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate spacewatch through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. (optional) Enable the At a Glance dashboard widget

Once you've completed those steps, you will be able to view the Spacewwatch widget right from your dashboard

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I don't see the progress bar on my dashboard... where is it?

Make sure that you have enabled the *At a Glance* dashboard widget. Once you've activated it, the progress bar will be appended to it right after the post counts.
